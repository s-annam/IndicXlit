Here's a summary of the key findings:

Data Coverage:
  * Successfully processed 19 languages (hin files were not found)
  * Each language has train/test/valid splits
  * Generated length distribution plots for each split
  * Saved detailed statistics in JSON format

Key Observations:
  * Most languages have good coverage in training sets (ranging from 10K to 4.1M pairs)
  * Malayalam (mal) has the largest training set with 4.1M pairs
  * Manipuri (mni) has the smallest training set with 10K pairs

Character set sizes are consistent:
  * English: 26 characters across all languages
  * Native: varies between 44-70 characters depending on the language

Data Quality:
  * Missing scores are common in test splits (expected as they're for evaluation)
  * Score ranges typically between -0.350 to 0.000 when present
  * Some languages have more missing fields than others

Source distribution varies:
  * IndicCorp is the largest source for most languages
  * Dakshina provides significant data for some languages
  * Various other sources (Wikidata, Samanantar, etc.) contribute smaller portions

Generated Files:
  * Length distribution plots: data/corpus_preprocessing/Analysis/plots/
  * Detailed statistics: data/corpus_preprocessing/Analysis/stats/

========================

Analysis of Hindi Dataset:

Size and Distribution:
  * Large training set (1.3M pairs), with smaller test (10K) and validation (6.3K) sets
  * Well-distributed across multiple data sources, with IndicCorp being the primary source (73.6%)

Word Length Characteristics:
  * Hindi words are consistently shorter than their English translations
  * Average length ratio (Hindi:English) is approximately 0.9:1
  * Training set shows longer average lengths (7.79:8.69) compared to validation set (6.54:7.47)
  * Rich character set usage: 69 unique Hindi characters in training, reducing to 62 in validation

Quality Metrics:
  * Confidence scores range from -0.350 to -0.002
  * Consistent mean scores across splits (train: -0.197, valid: -0.192)
  * Notable number of missing scores (26.4% in training set)

Source Distribution:
  * Diverse sources ensure variety in the dataset
  * Hierarchical contribution: IndicCorp > Samanantar > Existing > Dakshina/Wikidata > AK-Freq
  * Test set focuses on AK-derived sources (AK-Freq, AK-NEF, AK-NEI) and Dakshina

Character Set Evolution:
  * Training set has the richest character set (69 chars)
  * Gradual reduction in character set size across splits (train: 69 → test: 64 → valid: 62)
  * Consistent English character set (26) across all splits

This analysis reveals a comprehensive Hindi transliteration dataset with good size, source diversity, and consistent quality metrics, though with some gaps in confidence scoring.
