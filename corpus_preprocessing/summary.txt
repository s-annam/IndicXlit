Here's a summary of the key findings:

Data Coverage:
  * Successfully processed 19 languages (hin files were not found)
  * Each language has train/test/valid splits
  * Generated length distribution plots for each split
  * Saved detailed statistics in JSON format

Key Observations:

  * Malayalam (mal) has the largest training set with 4.1M pairs
  * Manipuri (mni) has the smallest training set with 10K pairs

Character set sizes are consistent:
  * English: 26 characters across all languages
  * Native: varies between 44-70 characters depending on the language

Data Quality:
  * Missing scores are common in test splits (expected as they're for evaluation)
  * Score ranges typically between -0.350 to 0.000 when present
  * Some languages have more missing fields than others

Source distribution varies:
  * IndicCorp is the largest source for most languages
  * Dakshina provides significant data for some languages
  * Various other sources (Wikidata, Samanantar, etc.) contribute smaller portions

Generated Files:
  * Length distribution plots: data/corpus_preprocessing/Analysis/plots/
  * Detailed statistics: data/corpus_preprocessing/Analysis/stats/
